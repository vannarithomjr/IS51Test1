# Test 1 - Samuel Vannarith Om Mercado

# Structured English:
"""
Even though there is mulltiple ways to solve question 1, one of the most easiest ways to do it is by creating
a function for each of the two possibles salaries. That is two functions labeled as option1 and option2.
option 1 is going to directly multiply the amount of money per day by the days worked. That is $100x10 = $1,000.
The option2 is going to use exponential. That would be 2^9. we set 2 because the amount doubles, and we set 9 instead
of 10 because we discount the first day with $1. After we get both of the final amounts, we use another function to
compare which value es higher and display a message stating which one is more convenient.
